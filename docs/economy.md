### Cobb-Douglas Production Function

The first principle of the Solow Growth Model is the Cobb-Douglas production function, which relates total production (GDP) to capital and labor. The formula is:

Y = A ⋅ K^α ⋅ L^(1-α)

Y is the total production.
A is the total factor productivity.
K is the capital.
L is the labor.
α is the output elasticity of capital.


### Capital Accumulation

The second principle is capital accumulation, where the change in capital over time is determined by the savings rate, total production, and the depreciation rate. The formula is:

ΔK = s ⋅ Y − δ ⋅ K

ΔK is the change in capital.
s is the savings rate.
δ is the depreciation rate of capital.


### Population Growth and Technological Progress

The third principle addresses the impact of population growth and technological progress. Population growth is represented by the rate n, while technological progress is represented by the rate g. In the steady state, the economy grows only due to technological progress. The formulas are:

#### Population Growth:

ΔL = n ⋅ L

ΔL: Change in the labor force.
n: Population growth rate.
L: Current population or labor force.

#### Technological Progress:

ΔA = g ⋅ A

ΔA: Change in the level of technology.
g: Rate of technological progress.
A: Current level of technology.
